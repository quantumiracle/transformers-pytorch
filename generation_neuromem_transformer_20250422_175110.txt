GROUND TRUTH:
ced by the nucleus is [[isotropic]] (it only depends on the distance to the nucleus). Although the resulting [[energy eigenfunctions]] (the &quot;orbitals&quot;) are not necessarily isotropic themselves, their dependence on the [[angular coordinates]] follows completely generally from this isotropy of the underlying potential: The states are not only [[eigenstates]] of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], but also eigenstates of the [[angular momentum operator]]. This corresponds to the fact
